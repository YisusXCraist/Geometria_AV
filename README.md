# Analytic Vectorial Geometry

This is an open-source Python library for performing operations with vectors in 3-dimensional space. The library provides functions for defining vectors, performing arithmetic operations with vectors (addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication), and computing the dot product and cross product of two vectors.

## Installation

To use this library, you can clone the repository from GitHub:

bash
git clone https://github.com/username/analytic-vectorial-geometry.git

## Usage

To use the library in your own Python code, you can import the Vector module:

```python
# Your Python code here
from Vector import Vector

v1 = Vector(1, 2, 3)
v2 = Vector(4, 5, 6)

```

## Add two vectors
```python
# Your Python code here
v3 = v1 + v2

```
## Subtract two vectors
```python
# Your Python code here
v4 = v1 - v2
```

## Multiply a vector by a scalar
```python
# Your Python code here
v5 = v1 * 2
```
## Compute the dot product of two vectors
```python
# Your Python code here
dot_product = v1.dot(v2)
```

## Compute the cross product of two vectors
```python
# Your Python code here
v6 = v1.cross(v2)
```

## Testing

This repository also includes a test suite for the Vector module. To run the tests, you can use the following command:

```python
# Your Python code here 
Tests.py
```

The tests include checks for addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product operations. The test suite also includes 3D plots of the vectors, which can be used to visually verify the results of the operations.
